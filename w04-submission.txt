Please answer the questions in this text file and submit it to I-Learn.

1. Copy and paste the URL for your source code repository (e.g., GitHub):
https://github.com/rdavis0/CSE341-node

3. Briefly list and describe the elements of the application that are functioning. 
    - Refactored everything into MVC pattern
    - Navigation enhancements
    - Add, edit, and delete products
    - Cart functionality
    - View products

4. Briefly describe any pieces of the assignment that are not yet working correctly.
    None

5. Briefly describe the "coolest" thing you learned while completing this assignment.
    I enjoyed getting a lot more practice with asynchronous functions. I have used them a few times before
    in Javascript, but they are difficult to wrap my head around, so it was helpful using them
    for various pieces of this assignement.

6. If you could change this assignment to be more effective or helpful, what would you change?
    Nothing on BYU-I's end this week, but I wish the course instructor gave a better overview
    of how to accomplish the thing he wants to do before diving into the code. He kind of 
    architects while he's coding, so it can be difficult to have a picture of why he's doing 
    what he's doing until it's all done.

7. Please select the category you feel best describes your assignment:
   1 - Some attempt was made
   2 - Developing, but significantly deficient
   3 - Slightly deficient, but still mostly adequate
   **4 - Meets requirements
   5 - Shows creativity and excels above and beyond requirements

8. Provide a brief justification (1-2 sentences) for selecting that category.
    I followed along with the videos and did everything there was to do.
